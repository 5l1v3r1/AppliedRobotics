\subsection{Detailed Description}
Interface blocks for SciCos written in C for communication with BROFist. The idea behind these blocks is simple: We use one block to control the socket, then various blocks to encode the requests. These requests and the socket descriptor (sent to other blocks as a standard integer value) are sent to various blocks that either send requests for sensors or send values to set the Speed or the Power for the Servo Motors. This kind of architecture is useful in case of new features implemented either on the \hyperlink{main_SPAM}{SPAM} Client or on the BROFist Server. However, an example file for SciCos has been provided under the {\ttfamily scicos} folder: {\ttfamily Comm\_\-Test.cos} \hypertarget{group___b_r_o_sci_cos_SimilOctave}{}\subsection{The understandability of the SciCosLab programming language}\label{group___b_r_o_sci_cos_SimilOctave}
You might want to browse throught the {\ttfamily }.sci files and this is a comprehensible thing to do, the problem is that the \char`\"{}Programming\char`\"{}, or should I say Scripting, Language used to interact with SciCosLab is poorly documented and almost ignored throught all the Internet. However, feel free to use those files to understand the language via the \char`\"{}Retro-\/Engineering\char`\"{}. Another great idea is to see how the provided blocks in SciCosLab were written.
