Interface functions used to encode requests for any Sensor.  


Interface functions used to encode requests for any Sensor. These simply have to be configured inside the SciCos Graphical Interface by setting the Port and the Sensor wanted. The values to use for the Sensors are:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item : Tachometric Counter
\item : Average Speed
\item : Light Sensor
\item : Touch Sensor
\item : Sound Sensor
\item : Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
\end{DoxyItemize}

While the Port values are  to  for the four Sensors' Ports, and from  to  for the Motors' Ports. The block itself has a system to check if the user input the values is a coherent way.
