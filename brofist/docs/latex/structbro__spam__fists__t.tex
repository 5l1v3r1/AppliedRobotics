\subsection{Detailed Description}
The structure containing BUFFER\_\-SIZE BROFists to send to the SPAM. This structure, as you can read below, contains also the dimension of the combined BUFFER\_\-SIZE. This is needed by the ecrobot\_\-read\_\-bt\_\-packet() function of the nxtOSEK system, since it requires the dimension of the packet to read from the BlueTooth buffer on the SPAM. A tricky way, really, that is not really needed, since that function requires both the buffer to write into AND the size of data to read. Really, it doesn't make much sense, but it works.

Size of the combined BROFists. 

It is an uint16\_\-t instead of an uint8\_\-t since the aforementioned ecrobot\_\-read\_\-bt\_\-packet() function requires the size of the packet to read to be 2 bytes large but only the first is used. Beats me if I know why is this way. However, another way to do this could have been \begin{DoxyVerb}
uint8_t size;
uint8_t padding; // Padding byte. Not used for anything else.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/headers/\hyperlink{bro__fist_8h}{bro\_\-fist.h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
