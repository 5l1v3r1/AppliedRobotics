\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains all the function used to Control Communication between SciCos and the Server. The general idea here is to have a set of funcions that controls the initialization and finalization for the communications via UNIX socket, another set to control the Dispatch of Fists to the SPAM Client for the request of a set of maxinum 7 sensors and the last one to dispatch the values for the Servo Motors.\hypertarget{group___b_r_o_cos_comm_Why7}{}\subsection{Why only 7 requests?}\label{group___b_r_o_cos_comm_Why7}
Some people might ask why there are seven requests on the sensor dispatching block. This has been simply chosen because there are 7 ports on an NXT 2.0, included the Servo Motors' ones. You could, in fact, request both the average speed AND the Tachometric count for each motor and four other sensors' values. That really is the limit case, so the ports have been set to seven because that would be the \char`\"{}standard\char`\"{} limit case. If you ever need more than three values for the Servo Motors it would be wise to use a Sensor Dispatcher for the Sensors and a Sensor Dispatcher for the Servo Motors, just to have the same value for the same moment for every motor.
