Collecting time and tacho from motor on port B

By bluetooth:
-> launch LEGO Mindstorm terminal
-> run start_bt_server
-> read collected data from /home/ubuntu/NXT/AppliedRobotics/motor_data

By USB:
-> go to folder NXT/usb_collector/usb_client
-> make all
-> go to folder NXT/usb_collector
-> ./download_usb_client 60 //where 60 is the setting for motor power
-> Run usb_client program on brick
-> ./start_usb_server 60 5000 //where 60 = file name; 5000 = time limit (ms)

if there're some issues with pip library:
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install pyusb

-> read collected data from /home/ubuntu/NXT/AppliedRobotics/motor_data

How to read and plot collected data:
-> go to folder AppliedRobotics/motor_data/
-> enter file "p60" and delete first row 			!!change this from code!!
-> mv p60 p60.mat //transform file "p60" to "p60.mat" !!this file cannot be called as a number (eg 60.mat)!!
-> load_scicoslab (from LEGO Mindstorm terminal)
-> scipad compute_velocity.sci (from ScicosLab terminal, file is stored in brofist/scicos_32)
-> Execute - load into Scilab (from Scipad menu bar)
-> go to folder AppliedRobotics/motor_data/ (from ScicosLab terminal)
-> loadmatfile('-ascii','p60') (from ScicosLab terminal)
-> compute_velocity(p50) (from ScicosLab terminal)
